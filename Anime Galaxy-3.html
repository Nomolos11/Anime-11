    <h1><i> BAKI </i></h1>
    <p><i>
        Hey guys it's me Nomolos-11 back to you with more Anime talk today we will
        be talking about the action Anime "BAKI" and his ambition to defeat his
        father which will be a big achievement because his father gained the title
        "the strongest creature on earth" but only because of personal reasons not
        because his father is the strongest throughout history it is truly an action
        Anime that fascinates me so i am going to put ep1-4 so enjoy.
